# Information Retrieval and Web Analytics (IRWA)
## Group 
**Group:** G_201_4

## Summary
Based on the learned from theoretical classes, the seminars, the lab exercises and our own research, we are asked to build using Python 3 a search engine implementing different indexing and ranking algorithms.

## Project Instructions
### Part 1:
In this part of the project, you will find the initial steps. Among them, the importation of the different elements that will be used in the project, these documents are located in the Data folder. Furthermore, a character cleaning process for the tweets has been performed using the preprocess() function. For easier data analysis, a date format change has also been applied using preprocess_date().

Next, in the second section, we have conducted a series of studies to better understand the data. Some of the studies include: Word cloud, Histogram, Boxplot, ... The results of these studies can be observed [here](https://github.com/ialexmp/IRWA/blob/master/part-1/IRWA-2023-u189626-u186665-u186661-part-1.pdf)

Finally, it's worth mentioning that to execute this, you simply need to run each of the cells in order.
