# Information Retrieval and Web Analytics (IRWA)
## Group 
**Group:** G_201_4

## Summary
Based on the learned from theoretical classes, the seminars, the lab exercises and our own research, we are asked to build using Python 3 a search engine implementing different indexing and ranking algorithms.
